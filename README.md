## Introduction

Multi-tenancy in cloud computing, while optimizing resource usage, introduces several security concerns. These concerns are highlighted by numerous attacks documented in both academic literature and industry reports. To address these issues, cloud service providers must ensure robust security measures, making accountability and transparency critical. PROSAS (Proactive Security Auditing System) is designed to provide continuous, efficient, and scalable security auditing, helping to build and maintain tenant trust.

### Security Challenges in Multi-Tenancy

1. **Dynamic Cloud Environments**: The continuous change in cloud environments requires real-time security auditing to keep up with dynamic states.
2. **Scalability and Efficiency**: The large scale and complexity of clouds demand an efficient auditing solution that does not hinder performance.
3. **Diverse Tenant Needs**: The varying requirements and usage patterns of tenants necessitate a flexible and adaptive auditing approach.

## Features

- **Automated Security Audits**: Perform continuous security scans on cloud resources.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detect and address security threats in real-time.
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale cloud environments efficiently.
- **Customizable Policies**: Adapt to the diverse needs of different tenants.
